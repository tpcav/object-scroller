    <ul>
      <li>Born and raised together in Northwest Philadelphia, ABBATIA was seemingly destined to take root.</li>
      <li>The unkempt trio of Syd Solanke, Jazz Vicaris, and Droogie have been creating together for virtually</li>
      <li>their entire lives before arriving upon the demented sonic hellscapes under the ABBATIA heraldry.</li>
      <li>Each member contributes vocals to the industrial walls of sound constructed by Syd, while Droogie creates</li>
      <li>the vibrant, restless visuals that accompany their music. The group takes influence from classic hip-hop ands</li>
      <li>punk in its purest form, as well as from surrealist film and litra-violent manga. While they sclipt their debut album, ABBATIA will be releasing a trilogy of EPs</li>
      <li>in early 2022 that will act as stepping stones to something greater. The future of ABBATIA is formless,</li>
      <li>spanning all genres and mlitimedia. With every new release, a brick is laid on the church’s foundation. </li>
      <li>Take a boat ride… to ABBATIA.</li>
    </ul>
